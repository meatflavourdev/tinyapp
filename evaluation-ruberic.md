|                                     | Exceptional                                                  | Acceptable                                                   | Needs Work                                                   | Unsatisfactory                                               |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Project Organization**            | The project's files and directories are sensibly structured, all necessary node.js packages are saved in `package.json`, and project setup is clearly documented. | The project's files and directories are sensibly structured with minor exceptions. All necessary node.js packages are saved in `package.json`, and project setup is straight-forward for non-novice developers. | The project's files and directories are poorly and/or inconsistently structured. The project's `package.json` is missing required packages and there is no project setup documentation. | The project's files and directories are illogically structured or not structured at all. The project's `package.json` is missing required packages and there is no project setup documentation. |
| **Version Control**                 | Commits were made frequently and deal with small, atomic changes. Commit messages clearly explain the changes made and are succinct. All files and directories that don't belong in the repo have been excluded using `gitignore` file. | Commits were made at sensible milestones, and for the most part commit messages clearly explain the changes made. Most files and directories that don't belong in the repo have been excluded using `gitignore` file. | Commits were generally made at sensible milestones in the project. Commit messages only sometimes clearly explain the changes made. Some files and directories that don't belong in the repo have been excluded using `gitignore` file. | All changes were added to the repo in one or two big commits, and/or commit messages are for the most part not useful. |
| **Functional Requirements**         | All major and minor functional requirements have been met, including stretch requirements. Some minor bugs may be present. | All major and minor functional requirements have been met. Some minor bugs may be present. | All major functional requirements have been met, but some minor functional requirements have not. Some non-trivial bugs may be present. | All major functional requirements have not been met.         |
| **Code Style**                      | Code is well-organized, very easy to read, and follows a conventional style consistently. | Code is generally well-organized and fairly easy to read.    | Code is mostly unorganized and can only be read by someone who knows what it's supposed to be doing. | Code is poorly-organized, very difficult to read, and inconsistently styled. |
| **Commenting**                      | Where necessary, comments are used to clearly explain what the code is doing and why, and are in an easy-to-understand and consistent style. | Comments are generally useful in helping a reader understand the code. | Comments mostly serve as a distraction to the reader or are missing where they are necessary. | Comments are not used to help the reader understand the code (they are unclear, redundant or missing). |
| **JavaScript Best Practices**       | JavaScript code consistently follows best practices.         | JavaScript code generally follows best practices.            | JavaScript code sometimes follows best practices.            | JavaScript code does not follow best practices.              |
| **Code Modularity and Reusability** | Code is sensibly modularized. Functions are single-serving, have no side-effects wherever possible, and helper functions are defined in appropriate cases. | Functions are generally single-serving and for the most part side-effect free. Some helper functions have been defined but not always in appropriate cases. | Functions are sometimes single-serving and may have side-effects that could be avoided. Little or no helper functions have been defined, or are used in inappropriate cases. | Code is not modularized or reusable.                         |
| **Solution Techniques**             | Solutions are correct, straight-forward and efficient without sacrificing readability and understanding. | Solutions are correct and fairly efficient.                  | Solutions are not always correct or are inefficient.         | Solutions are incorrect, heavily over-engineered or brute force. |
